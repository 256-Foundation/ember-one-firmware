# Ember One: Firmware

This repository contains RP2040 USB device-side firmware for the Ember One board
management controller.

### Developing

Install Rust:

```Shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi

cargo install probe-rs-tools --locked
cargo install elf2uf2-rs --locked
cargo install cargo-binutils
```

For SWD-based development and debugging:

```Shell
# Build the latest firmware:
cargo build --release

# Build, program, and attach to the device:
cargo run --release

# Just flash the device, don't attach to RTT:
cargo flash --release --chip RP2040

# Erase all flash memory:
probe-rs erase --chip RP2040 --allow-erase-all
```

For UF2-based development:

```Shell
# Build the latest firmware:
cargo build --release

# Convert the ELF to an RP2040-compatible UF2 image:
elf2uf2-rs target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/firmware firmware.uf2

# Convert and deploy the UF2 image to an mounted RP2040:
elf2uf2-rs -d target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/firmware
```
